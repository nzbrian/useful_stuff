#I see direct usb://Brother/HLblah

#to get this Brother printer working on Ubuntu 18.04 I had to:
#1 - think I had to add myself as a CUPS user like this
sudo usermod -aG lpadmin brian
#2 - ssh port forward 631 from my local machine to access CUPS webservice
#3 - configure that to allow remote administration and to share all printers
#4 - install 32 bit compatibility like this
apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
#5 create a directory needed by the Brother LPD driver:
sudo mkdir /var/spool/lpd
#6 - install the correct Brother LPD and CUPSwrapper pacakges from the Brother website
sudo dpkg -i hl3150cdnlpr-1.1.2-1.i386.de
sudo dpkg -i hl3150cdncupswrapper-1.1.2-1.i386.deb
#7 - add that as a local printer on the CUPS webservice


#didn't need any of the below
#============================#

sudo vi /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
#remove the line: Listen localhost:631
#add the line: Port 631

sudo systemctl restart cups

sudo usermod -aG lpadmin root
sudo usermod -aG lpadmin brian
